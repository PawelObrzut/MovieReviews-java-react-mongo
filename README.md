# The Movie Review Web Application

### The backend api is written in java powered by spring boot and intellij. The REST operations are exposed to the frontend build with react-vite and the data is stored in atlas mongoDB.

### I built this project to learn ***Java*** and I decided to do it on the fly. Knowing a lot about Typescript, some Python and GoLang I wanted a shortcut here. Learning slowly how to write variables and functions seemed just wrong. Diving streight into spring framework as well as maven software were intuitive and easy to follow.
